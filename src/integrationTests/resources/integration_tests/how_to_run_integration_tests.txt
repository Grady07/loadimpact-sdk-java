In order for the integration tests to run, it requires a valid API token to run. Follow these steps:

(1) Create a LoadImpact account, unless you already have it.

(2) Get the API token.
    (a) Open the user profile (click a username)
    (b) Choose tab "API Token"
    (c) Generate a token, if needed
    (d) Save the token for later use

(3a) Provide the API token directly
     Using the Java system property "loadimpact.token"
     
(3b) Provide the API token via a properties file
     Create a file with one single line (including EOL)
        api.token=<your API token string here>
     Provide the token-file by any of:
    (i)     Save it with the file path "../loadimpact-token.properties" (i.e. in the parent directory)
    (ii)    Set the Java system property "loadimpact.token.file" with the file path
    (iii)   Set the environment variable "LOADIMPACT_TOKEN_FILE" with the file path
