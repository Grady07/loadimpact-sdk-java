(2) Get the API token.
    (a) Open the user profile (click a username)
    (b) Choose tab "API Token"
    (c) Generate a token, if needed
    (d) Save the token to a Java properties file
    (e) Add one single line (including EOL)
        api.token=<your API token string here>

(3) Save the token file 
    (alt 1) Save it with the file path "../loadimpact-token.properties" (i.e. in the parent director of this project)
    (alt 2) Set the Java system property "loadimpact.token.file" with the file path
    (alt 3) Set the environment variable "LOADIMPACT_TOKEN_FILE" with the file path

(4) Create a test named "integration_test" and configure it to:
